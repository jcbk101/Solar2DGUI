# Solar2DGUI
 A generic Solar2D GUI designer

This software is in the early stages of development. It is usable in its current
state. 

# Building Solar2DGUI
Embarcadero's C++ Builder 10.4 Free Community version is used to build a working version of this
for windows. There is built in support for MAc, but not yet tested as I do not own a MAC.

Feel free to modify this program to fit your needs. I will monitor any and all pull requests
and attempt to update the source accordingly.

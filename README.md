# Solar2DGUI
 A generic Solar2D GUI designer

This software is in the early stages of development. It is usable in its current
state. 

# Building Solar2DGUI
Embarcadero's C++ Builder 10.4 Free Community version is used to build a working version of this
program for windows. There is built in support for MAC, but not yet tested as I do not own a MAC.

Feel free to modify this program to fit your needs. I will monitor any and all pull requests
and attempt to update the source accordingly.

# Purpose
As a new to Solar2D developer, I found it rather difficult at times to design a simple
GUI for the games I develop. Constantly changes values and testing in the simulator became a tedious task.
As I build upon this program, I aim to make tasks easier for developers by providing a utility to allow
visual designing and animation testing. Animations are supported, but are limited. All designs can be
exported to any project folder. All exported files will be '<b>[Project Name].lua</b>' 

Any image files used within the editor ill be copied to a subdirectory named '<b>assets</b>' withinthe
chosen project directory.
